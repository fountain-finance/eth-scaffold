### mainnet

Copies contract artifacts to git-tracked directory: packages/react-fountain/src/contracts/mainnet

yarn deploy-mainnet
```

### ropsten

---

## react-fountain .env

reference `packages/react-fountain/.example.env`

```bash
REACT_APP_INFURA_ID=
REACT_APP_PROVIDER=
REACT_APP_DEV_NETWORK=
```
`REACT_APP_INFURA_ID`: Your [Infura](https://infura.io/) key.

`REACT_APP_DEV_NETWORK`: (options: `local`, `ropsten`, `mainnet`) network used by frontend during development. Requires contract artifacts to be present in `packages/react-fountain/src/contracts/\<network-name>` which are generated after a deployment to that network.

---

## üîè Web3 Providers:

The frontend has three different providers that provide different levels of access to different chains:

`mainnetProvider`: (read only) [Infura](https://infura.io/) connection to main [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/developers/) network (and contracts already deployed like [DAI](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f#code) or [Uniswap](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2a1530c4c41db0b0b2bb646cb5eb1a67b7158667)).

`localProvider`: local [HardHat](https://hardhat.org) accounts, used to read from _your_ contracts (`.env` file points you at testnet or mainnet)

`injectedProvider`: your personal [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/download.html), [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.org/apps) via [Argent](https://www.argent.xyz/), or other injected wallet (generates [burner-provider](https://www.npmjs.com/package/burner-provider) on page load)
